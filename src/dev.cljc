;; About instrumentation and probing that is really useful during development. Lots
;; of intentional crashing (i.e. asserts) here, but also instrumentation things like
;; warnings and pretty printing. Eventually we will elide the crashing out during runtime
;; and make into macros in case the asserts are heavy. For nuts and bolts of that (elide
;; crashing and macros) see a similar library:
;; https://github.com/astoeckley/clojure-assistant
;; When this application becomes 'really professional' then perhaps there will be no calls
;; to this ns, as spec and proper logging framework do the same thing.
;; That's why we call it 'dev'
;;

;;
;; My own invention, is it a list or a vector?
;; Guards against: UnsupportedOperationException nth not supported on this type: PersistentArrayMap
;; , which happens if you try nth on a map:
;; `(nth {1 2} 0)`
;; `(let [[a] {1 2}] a)`
;; , the destructuring case being the common bug
